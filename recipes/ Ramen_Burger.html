    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Instant ramen becomes a nearly-instant burger bun in this fun, and tasty, spin on a traditional hamburger seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages instant ramen noodles, flavor packet discarded<hr></li>
        <li>2 large eggs<hr></li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste<hr></li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar<hr></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce<hr></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil<hr></li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided<hr></li>
        <li>3 slices American cheese<hr></li>
        <li>¼ cup ketchup<hr></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha)<hr></li>
        <li>1 ½ cups arugula<hr></li>
        <li>3 large eggs<hr></li>


    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Bring a pot of water to a boil; add ramen noodles. Boil, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, about <strong>3 minutes</strong>. Drain. Allow noodles to cool slightly. <hr></li>
        <li>Beat 2 eggs in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Stir noodles into eggs until evenly coated. Divide noodles into 6 burger-size ramekins or bowls. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly over noodles and stack another bowl on top to flatten noodles. Refrigerate until firm, about <strong>20 minutes</strong>.<hr> </li>
        <li>Mix beef, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a bowl. Divide beef mixture into three equal portions and shape into patties. <hr></li>
        <li>Heat about 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Invert each ramen bowl, gently tapping the bottom of the bowl until ramen loosens, careful to maintain bun shape.<hr> </li>
        <li> Fry each ramen bun, without moving noodles, in hot oil until golden brown, about <strong>3 minutes</strong>. Flip each bun and continue frying until crisp, <strong>3 to 5</strong> minutes more. Ramen bun should be crispy on one side and slightly softer on the other. Transfer buns to large plate with the crispy side up.<hr> </li>
        <li> Heat about 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the same skillet used to fry ramen over medium heat. Cook beef patties until burgers are lightly pink in the center, <strong>3 to 5 minute</strong> per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Arrange a slice of American cheese over each burger and continue to cook until melted, about 1 minute more. <hr></li>
        <li> Mix ketchup and chile-garlic sauce in a small bowl; spread mixture over the crispy side of each ramen bun. Divide arugula over 3 ramen buns. Place burgers over arugula.<hr> </li>
        <li> Heat about 1 teaspoon oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat; fry remaining eggs one at a time, adding more oil as needed, until yolk is almost firm, about <strong>1 minutes</strong> per side. Place egg over patty and top with remaining bun.<hr> </li>
    </ol>
